# TTElements
Top Trumps game for the chemical elements, implemented using the Python socket library.

Depends only on the Python standard libraries socket, random and time.

Port forwarding will need to be set up in order to play. The default port is set as 5555, but can be changed at the end of the ttelements_server.py file.

To play, start the server script and set the number of players. Each player may then start their client scripts and when prompted should enter the server's ip address and the port number (default 5555).
